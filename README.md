# Malware-Classification
Malicious Software is being a whopping proliferate these days. It is crucial to
differentiate and classify the malware or malicious software for better perception of
how they vitiate computers and other devices, the threat extent they produce and how
to safeguard against them.
Malware classification is accomplished by using InceptionResNetV2 model in this
paper. Primarily, the executable files are metamorphosed into images and then
InceptionResNetV2 Convolutional Neural Network model is applied to classify the
malware. InceptionResNetV2 model is Convolutional Neural Network architecture
model recently launched and is very powerful with less over fitting problems and takes
less time though. Howbeit fewer cases of InceptionResNetV2 Convolution Neural
Network model are only found in publications, and not at all used till date to resolve
the malicious software categorization problem. The accomplishment of this method
analogized to other approaches like KNN, Inception, SVM, ResNet, VGG16, NASNet
etc. The datasets used are Malimg dataset and Microsoft Malware dataset. Using these
it is verified that the InceptionResNetV2 system will obtain the highest accuracy of
testing and the highest accuracy of validation relative to all other methods like the
Xception model. In addition, the novel Ensemble model is often used in this work to
combine .bytes and .asm data.
While the Microsoft Malware Dataset Champion obtained a marginally lower log loss,
this strategy will not include any development capabilities, rendering it more flexible
to respond to any potential malware progression and far less time intensive than the
Champion's solution.
